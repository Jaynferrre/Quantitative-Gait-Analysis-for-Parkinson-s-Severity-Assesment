# Quantitative-Gait-Analysis-for-Parkinson-s-Severity-Assesment
This is my submission for my course project requirement for DH302(Introduction to Public Health Informatics) by KCDH, IIT Bombay, working under Professors Saket Choudhary and Nirmal Punjabi in the Autumn Semester, 2025. I collaborated with Ishan Yadu, from ESED IIT Bombay on this project.

## Problem Statement
- Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily caused by a deficiency of dopamine in the brain. This chemical imbalance leads to debilitating motor symptoms that significantly impair quality of life.
- Patients typically present with bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, resting tremors, and postural instability. As the disease progresses, these
symptoms disrupt daily mobility and increase the risk of falls.

## Societal Impact 
- Experts estimate that India is poised to have the highest absolute prevalence of the disease globally, with rates ranging from 15 to 43 per 100,000 people. Most alarmingly, the demographic profile is shifting younger.
- Approximately 40-45% of Indian patients present with Early Onset Parkinson’s Disease (EOPD), experiencing motor symptoms between the ages of 22 and 49.
- The average age of onset in India is now 51 years, nearly a decade younger than the global average, necessitating immediate and scalable diagnostic interventions.
- Currently, management relies on a combination of pharmacological treatments like Levodopa, surgical interventions such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), and holistic care including nutrition and physiotherapy.
- However, accurate tracking of these motor symptoms is crucial for effective management

## Hypothesis 
Gait kinematic parameters (specifically gait speed and Timed Up and Go duration), when integrated with demographic factors (Age, BMI), serve as robust, non-invasive biomarkers for classifying the severity of Parkinson's Disease(Hoehn & Yahr stages)
