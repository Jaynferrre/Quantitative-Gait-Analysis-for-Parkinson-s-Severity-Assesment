# Quantitative-Gait-Analysis-for-Parkinson-s-Severity-Assesment
This is my submission for my course project requirement for DH302(Introduction to Public Health Informatics) by KCDH, IIT Bombay, working under Professors Saket Choudhary and Nirmal Punjabi in the Autumn Semester, 2025. I collaborated with Ishan Yadu, from ESED IIT Bombay on this project.

## Problem Statement
- Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily caused by a deficiency of dopamine in the brain. This chemical imbalance leads to debilitating motor symptoms that significantly impair quality of life.
- Patients typically present with bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, resting tremors, and postural instability. As the disease progresses, these
symptoms disrupt daily mobility and increase the risk of falls.

## Hypothesis 
Gait kinematic parameters (specifically gait speed and Timed Up and Go duration), when integrated with demographic factors (Age, BMI), serve as robust, non-invasive biomarkers for classifying the severity of Parkinson's Disease(Hoehn & Yahr stages)
